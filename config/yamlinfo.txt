# ForensicTimeliner YAML Configuration Guide

## Structure
Each YAML file defines a forensic artifact configuration with the following structure:

artifact: [NAME]            # Required: Name of the artifact 
tool: [TOOL]                # Required: Source tool (EZ Tools, Chainsaw, etc.)
description: [DESCRIPTION]  # Required: Brief description of the artifact
enabled: true|false         # Optional: Whether this artifact is active (default: true)

discovery:                  # Required: Rules for finding artifact files
  filename_patterns:        # Required: List of filename patterns to match
    - [PATTERN1]
    - [PATTERN2]
  foldername_patterns:      # Required: List of folder name patterns to match
    - [PATTERN1]
    - [PATTERN2]
  required_headers:         # Required: List of CSV headers to expect
    - [HEADER1]
    - [HEADER2]
  strict_filename_match: true|false  # Optional: Exact match for filenames (default: false)
  strict_folder_match: true|false    # Optional: Exact match for folders (default: false)

filters:                    # Optional: Additional filtering rules (MFT and EventLogs only)
  extensions:               # Optional: List of file extensions to include (MFT only)
    - [EXTENSION1]
    - [EXTENSION2]
  paths:                    # Optional: List of paths to include (MFT only)
    - [PATH1]
    - [PATH2]
  event_channel_filters:    # Optional: Event log channels and IDs to include (EventLogs only)
    [CHANNEL1]: [ID1, ID2, ID3]
    [CHANNEL2]: [ID1, ID2, ID3]

## Examples

### Standard Artifact
artifact: ActivityTimeline
tool: EZ Tools
description: Windows Activity Timeline
enabled: true
discovery:
  filename_patterns:
    - _Activity.csv
  foldername_patterns:
    - ProgramExecution
  required_headers:
    - Id
    - ActivityTypeOrg
  strict_filename_match: true
  strict_folder_match: false

### MFT Artifact with Filters
artifact: MFT
tool: EZ Tools
description: MFT Created
discovery:
  filename_patterns:
    - *MFTECmd*$MFT_Output.csv
  foldername_patterns:
    - FileSystem
  required_headers:
    - EntryNumber
    - SequenceNumber
    # (other headers)
  strict_filename_match: false
  strict_folder_match: false
enabled: true
filters:
  extensions:
    - .identifier
    - .exe
    - .ps1
    - .zip
    - .rar
    - .7z
  paths:
    - Users

### Event Logs Artifact with Filters
artifact: EventLogs
tool: EZ Tools
description: Windows Event Logs
discovery:
  filename_patterns:
    - _events.csv
  foldername_patterns:
    - EventLogs
  required_headers:
    - Channel
    - EventID
    # (other headers)
  strict_filename_match: false
  strict_folder_match: false
enabled: true
filters:
  event_channel_filters:
    Security: [1102, 4624, 4625, 4648, 4698, 4702]
    System: [7045]
    Application: [1000, 1001]
    Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational: [4100, 4103, 4104]

## Notes
- Set 'enabled: false' to disable an artifact without deleting its configuration
- When strict_filename_match is false, partial matches are allowed
- When strict_folder_match is false, partial matches are allowed
- At least half of required_headers must match when doing header-based discovery
- Filters are only applicable to certain artifact types:
  - MFT artifacts support 'extensions' and 'paths' filters
  - EventLogs artifacts support 'event_channel_filters'
- Extension filters should include the dot (e.g., '.exe' not 'exe')
- Path filters are partial matches (e.g., 'Users' will match any path containing 'Users')
- Event channel filters specify which event IDs to include for each channel
